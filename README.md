üêç Neovim: your Personalized IDE

## Abstract

As developers continue to embrace Python for their projects, the need for a powerful, flexible, and efficient development environment has become increasingly important. [Neovim](https://neovim.io/) is an open-source text editor designed to enhance the traditional Vim editor, providing a modern, extensible, and highly configurable tool for developers.

In this context, using Neovim as a Python development environment offers numerous benefits, such as keyboard driven development, streamlined workflows, and a range of plugins and extensions to enhance productivity. Neovim's modular architecture allows for customization, automation, and integration with other tools and frameworks.

The goal of this talk is to set you up with Neovim without losing beloved features like Python language support, autocompletion, testing, file navigation, among others. In the course of 30 minutes, I will walk you through a base configuration that you can build atop of to make an IDE that is truly yours.

## Talk Overview

- **Introduction to Neovim:** core offering, pros and cons, lua language for pythonistas
- **Neovim for Python Development:** plugin manager, navigation, terminal integration, lsp, testing
- **Wrap up:** brief look at my personal config and learning resources to continue your journey

## Requirements

- [docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/) and [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/): if you want to run Neovim from a preconfigured container
